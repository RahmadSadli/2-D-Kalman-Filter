# 2-D Kalman Filter for tracking a moving object.

Accompanying code for tutorial "Object Tracking: 2-D Object Tracking using Kalman Filter in Python"
Tutorial's link:
https://machinelearningspace.com/2d-object-tracking-using-kalman-filter/

This code has been tested on Windows 10/11 using Anaconda. (Python 3.9 and OpenCV 4.7)

Requirements:
- Python 3.9
- opencv 4.7 

Create your conda environment:
- conda create -n your_ENV_NAME python=3.9

Install these two libraries:
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install opencv-python   ==>(This will install you OpenCV 4.7.0.68 at the moment I'm updating this repo January 20,2023)

Cheers
